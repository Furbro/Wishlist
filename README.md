This is a project for making a wishlist
Long term:

- I want to have a standard neutral, just making a wish or seeing yourself having something that you don't as of right now. Which is culture inclusive, but not based on any religion. It is a list for yourself most of all, but also one you can share.
- I also want to have a theme based styling based on 2 or 4 seasons depending on where in the world you live. That you can also customnise on screen.
- I want also want to show of what I've learned, so have several links on screen for changing the CSS like in the course.

- I also want a thingsIwantYouToBuyToMe button to add a wishlist mostly meant for birthdays.

- So the original page is like a webpage thats mostly for fun while showcasing my progress, so the wishlist itsealf is updated long term while I'm learning to a point where you can use it as an app.

* talk to write
* changing styling
* moving images
* responsive app or webpage
* able to recieve a list you can send as an image on your phone.
* security if the app turns pay to play, screenshot is either unavalable or just black
